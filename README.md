You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Notes to self:
- There are some weird edge cases, like where John Kerry ran as a "Democratic-Nonpartisan League" member in North Dakota in 2004. Should he count as a Democrat or as Third Party?
- Would be potentially interesting to show third party as a stacked bar chart to cover these instances, but that may also get messy given how incredibly small these cases are in most states
